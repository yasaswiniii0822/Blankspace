🖌️ Blankspace — Art Block Helper
Blankspace is a gentle, AI-powered chatbot designed to help creatives overcome art block and start creating again — without pressure, perfectionism, or overwhelm.
Instead of flooding users with inspiration, Blankspace focuses on small, actionable prompts that make starting feel possible.

🎨 What is Art Block?
Art block is a mental state where a person wants to create but feels unable to start or continue.

It can show up as:
Staring at a blank page or canvas
Feeling overwhelmed by too many ideas
Fear of making something “bad”
Low energy or lack of motivation
Art block is not laziness.
It’s often caused by pressure, self-judgment, burnout, or overthinking.

❗ Why Art Block is a Real Problem

For many artists, designers, writers, and hobbyists:
Creativity is tied to identity
Being unable to create leads to guilt and frustration
Long periods of art block can cause people to abandon creative habits entirely
Most tools try to “inspire” artists with more ideas — which often makes the block worse.

What people actually need is:
Permission to start small
Clear direction
A calm, non-judgmental space
